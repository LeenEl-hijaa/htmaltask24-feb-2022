    <h1>Pokemon</h1>
    <p>Pokémon is a Japanese franchise that has been around for more than 20 years (2021 will mark its 25th anniversary!). Short for “pocket monsters,” Pokémon exists as a TV show, a trading card game, video games and toys. The Pokémon themselves are creatures that live in the wild or with their owner (as in your kid), referred to as their trainer. The trainer's goal is to “catch them all” and, by all, we mean all 800+ of them. </p>
